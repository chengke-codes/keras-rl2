## Development

### Running tests

To run tests, you need to have all dependencies specified in `requirements-dev.txt` 
(in addition to the user dependencies in setup.py). 
Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install them with pip.

Now you should be able to launch tests using `pytest tests` 
from the root folder.
